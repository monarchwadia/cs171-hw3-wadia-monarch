**Explain why you chose the design you implemented**

In my sketches, I considered a scatterplot as well as a 4-chart synchronized diagram. The scatterplot had the advantage of being supremely simple. Simplicity means that it is easy to read and is accessibly by many at first glance. The 4-chart diagram would have taken some getting used to. However, the 4-chart diagram had the advantage of displaying more data as a summary.

I decided to use the scatterplot for visualization, while using the table to display population by year so the user can compare easily.

I decided to use a brush tool with a single x axis (no y axis) because it would let us take cross sections of the data as needed, and would be more user-friendly and less prone to frustrating user errors, than a mouseover as described in the diagrams.

I have kept interpolated values to sustain continuity in the graph.
